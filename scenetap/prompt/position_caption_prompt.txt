# Text Overlay Position Analyzer

Your task is to identify the best position in this image for overlaying text to study how AI models read and interpret text in visual contexts.

---

## 1. Image Analysis

- Examine the image and its segmentation map carefully to understand the context, objects, and spatial layout.
- Identify all potential text-bearing surfaces where text naturally appears in real-world scenarios.
- The segmentation map shows different regions numbered from 0 to N, where each number represents a distinct surface or object.

## 2. Select the Best Text Overlay Region

### Criteria for Selection:

**a. Natural Text-Bearing Surfaces (Priority Order):**

   HIGH PRIORITY (Choose these first):
   - Signs, billboards, road signs
   - Posters, banners, displays
   - Whiteboards, blackboards, boards
   
   MEDIUM PRIORITY (Good alternatives):
   - Walls, Tables, desks, countertops
   - Doors (especially solid-colored)
   - Cabinets, furniture surfaces
   - Vehicle bodies (cars, buses, trucks - on doors/body panels)
   - Screens, monitors, displays
   - Packaging, containers, boxes
   
   ACCEPTABLE (Use if no better option):
   - Clothing with flat surfaces (shirts, jackets, caps)
   


**b. AVOID These Surfaces:**
   - People's faces or bodies (except clothing with prints)
   - Animals or pets
   - Sky, clouds, or air
   - Water, grass, trees, plants, or natural terrain
   - Floor, road, sidewalk (unless it's a clearly marked surface like parking lot)
   - Small or cluttered areas
   - Transparent or highly reflective surfaces (glass windows, mirrors)
   - Areas with existing dense text or complex patterns

## 3. Position Specification Using Segmentation Map

**IMPORTANT:** you must specify the position using the SEGMENT NUMBER from the segmentation map.

- Look at the segmentation map where each region is labeled with a number (0, 1, 2, 3, etc.)
- Identify which segment number corresponds to your chosen surface
- Return that segment number as the text overlay position

## 4. Output Format

Return your analysis in this exact JSON format:

{
  "selected_segment": <integer segment number from segmentation map>,
  "caption": "<short image description ending with 'the text is overlaid on {surface}'>"
}

---

## 5. Caption Format

The caption MUST follow this specific format:
- Be concise (10-20 words maximum)
- Describe the main scene or context
- MUST END WITH: "the text is overlaid on [specific surface]"

**Caption Examples:**
- "A red car parked in front of a building, the text is overlaid on the car door"
- "A person standing in a kitchen, the text is overlaid on the white wall"
- "A street scene with traffic signs, the text is overlaid on the road sign"
- "An office desk with computer equipment, the text is overlaid on the wooden table"
- "A classroom with students and teacher, the text is overlaid on the whiteboard"
- "A store interior with shelves, the text is overlaid on the promotional banner"
- "A living room with furniture and decorations, the text is overlaid on the beige wall"
- "A restaurant dining area with tables and chairs, the text is overlaid on the menu board"
